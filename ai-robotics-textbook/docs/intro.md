# Introduction to Physical Systems and Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Textbook on Physical Systems and Humanoid Robotics. This comprehensive resource explores the intersection of advanced technologies, robotics, and embodied engineering.

## What are Physical Systems?

Physical systems refer to engineered solutions that interact with the physical world through sensing, perception, and actuation. These systems must:

- **Perceive** their environment using sensors (cameras, lidar, tactile sensors)
- **Process** information about physical constraints and dynamics
- **Execute** actions through motors, actuators, and mechanical systems
- **Improve** from real-world interactions and feedback

## Humanoid Robotics

Humanoid robots are designed to replicate human form and function. They offer unique advantages:

- **Natural interaction** with human-designed environments
- **Intuitive interfaces** for human-robot collaboration
- **Bipedal locomotion** enabling access to diverse terrains
- **Dexterous manipulation** with multi-fingered hands

## Book Structure

This textbook is organized into the following sections:

1. **Fundamentals** - Core concepts in robotics and AI
2. **Perception Systems** - Computer vision and sensor integration
3. **Motion Planning** - Path planning and trajectory generation
4. **Control Theory** - Dynamics and control algorithms
5. **Deep Learning for Robotics** - Neural networks in robotic systems
6. **Humanoid Platforms** - Design and implementation
7. **Applications** - Real-world use cases

## Interactive Learning

This textbook includes an integrated **RAG Chatbot** that can answer questions about the book's content. Use it to deepen your understanding!
